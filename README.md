		<h2>‘ToDo List’ Project</h2>
		<div>'ToDo List' app allows you, as a user, to create many lists to structure all tasks you have to do.</p>
		<h4>How it works?</h4>
		<p>New user can create an account in an app by adding information about himself. 
		After this, user have to log in a system and start work.
		User can see a list of all users in a system, but have no access to manipulate with data. 
		Only user, whose role is 'admin' can do any changes in list of users. </div>
